A web‚Äêservice stack supports a responsive UI if it offers dynamic pages or JSON APIs, ensures data freshness by being JSON-native or providing session support, enables non-blocking interactions through a non-blocking server, and achieves streamlined communication by being event-driven or JSON-native. A stack is deemed suitable only when it satisfies all of these criteria. The best practice is: choose a stack that combines dynamic page or JSON API support, JSON-native or session-based freshness, a non-blocking server, and event-driven or JSON-native communication.
