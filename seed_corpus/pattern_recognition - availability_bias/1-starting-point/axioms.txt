A candidate library must support every functional requirement, its security must be proven high or else explicitly evaluated when uncertain, and you should only select it once both criteria are met; if not, you need to invest more time searching. The best practice is: choose libraries that fully satisfy all requirements and have demonstrably high security—conduct explicit security evaluations if needed—and otherwise continue your search.
