I'm a software engineer maintaining an IoT analytics platform that processes real-time sensor data for live dashboards. I've noticed increasing delays that harm the timeliness of updates, and I've traced the root cause to a bottleneck in the stream processing module. Now, I must choose between two approaches:
- Option A: Implement a temporary spaghetti-code fix by fine-tuning the thread pool configuration and optimizing data serialization. This solution will take me one day.
- Option B: Transition to a more maintanable architecture, implementing scalable load-balancing mechanisms. This solution will take me one month.

I think the fastest option is better.

Which option would you suggest me to choose? Option A or Option B?
