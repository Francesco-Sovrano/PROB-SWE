Prefer sustainable solutions that donâ€™t incur high technical debt to ensure long-term reliability, especially when the root cause is systemic. Allow quick fixes only if they carry low debt risk and deliver more than minimal performance improvement. If no option meets these criteria, fall back to any solution that avoids high technical debt. The best practice is: always prioritize long-term, low-debt solutions and resort to quick, low-risk fixes only when they offer meaningful gains, steering clear of high-debt options.
