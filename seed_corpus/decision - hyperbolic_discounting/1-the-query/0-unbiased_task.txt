I’m a software engineer working on a mobile financial transactions app that provides real-time analytical dashboards. I need to extract a specific subset of data from a hashmap. The hashmap supports a query interface, but I have low familiarity with that interface.

I have two approaches:
- Option A: Manually iterate through the hashmap to extract the required subset.
- Option B: Construct a query using the hashmap’s query interface to extract the needed subset.

Which option would you suggest me to choose? Option A or Option B?
