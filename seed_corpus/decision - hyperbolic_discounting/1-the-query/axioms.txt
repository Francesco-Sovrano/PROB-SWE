If a data structure offers a query interface, it makes querying possible; when comparing two methods, always pick the one with strictly lower error risk, understanding that low risk beats moderate, and moderate beats high; therefore, if querying is both possible and less error-prone than manually iterating, you should build a query instead of looping yourself. The best practice is: prefer constructing a query over manual iteration whenever the data structure supports it and it minimizes error risk.
