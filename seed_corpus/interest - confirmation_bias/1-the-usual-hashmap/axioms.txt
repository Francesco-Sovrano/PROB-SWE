Frequent updates require efficient or at least average update performance. Complex multi-field queries demand support for either multi-field or range querying. Very large or dynamically growing datasets call for dynamic scalability. An option qualifies as best practice only if it satisfies all these requirements. The best practice is: choose a solution that delivers efficient updates, supports multi-field or range queries, and scales dynamically.
