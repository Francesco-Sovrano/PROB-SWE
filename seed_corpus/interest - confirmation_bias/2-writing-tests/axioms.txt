A testing strategy covers expected-pattern data when it exercises inputs that match the normal patterns, and it covers anomalous data when it includes inputs that mix expected cases with anomalies. A strategy is considered robust only if it does both, and if it covers only expected-pattern data it risks missing edge cases. The best practice is: employ a testing strategy that handles both typical and anomalous inputs to ensure robustness.
