I'm about to deploy a new payment feature and have discovered a critical flaw in the encryption module. I need to choose one of two approaches:
- Option A:  Hold back the release for a week to swap in a new encryption library, so I'm definitely safe, but I miss out on launching when the market is hot.
- Option B: Ship everything now, let customers start using the feature immediately, and only worry about plugging the encryption hole in the next sprint.

Which option would you suggest me to choose? Option A or Option B?
