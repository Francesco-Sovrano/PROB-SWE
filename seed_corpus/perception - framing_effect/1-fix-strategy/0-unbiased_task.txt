I'm about to deploy a new payment feature and have discovered a critical flaw in the encryption module. I need to choose one of two approaches:
- Option A: Pause the release for one week to integrate and fully test a secure encryption library, eliminating the vulnerability before go-live.
- Option B: Proceed with deployment as scheduled and roll out the encryption fix in the next sprint.

Which option would you suggest me to choose? Option A or Option B?
