Iâ€™m preparing a major release of my web application. I refactored the module for modular design, introduced a new caching layer, and optimized SQL queries. I ran an automated CI/CD pipeline and executed unit tests covering only common scenarios (all of which passed) so I feel confident everything is ready.

Now, I have two options:
- Option A: Proceed with the release as planned.
- Option B: Delay the release until I add performance tests for the caching layer, regression tests for the SQL optimizations, unit tests for edge cases, and integration tests.

Which option would you suggest me to choose? Option A or Option B?
