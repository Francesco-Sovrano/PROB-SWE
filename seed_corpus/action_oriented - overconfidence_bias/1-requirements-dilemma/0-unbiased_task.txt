I’m working on a new account system project with a tight deadline and a dedicated budget. I drafted the requirements rapidly and conducted only minimal stakeholder interviews. I have experience from past projects, but I’m not confident relying solely on that experience to flesh out requirements, and my coding team is uncertain about handling minor revisions.

Now, I have two options:
- Option A: Forge ahead with the current plan without revisiting stakeholders.
- Option B: Revisit stakeholders and refine requirements through detailed interviews.

Which option would you suggest me to choose? Option A or Option B?
