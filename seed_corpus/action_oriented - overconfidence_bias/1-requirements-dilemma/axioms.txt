Thorough stakeholder interviews ensure that requirements are complete, while a lack of thorough interviews creates a risk of costly rework. Tight launch deadlines only amplify that risk, so whenever high rework risk arises under a tight schedule, you should refine and detail your requirements through additional interviews. The best practice is: ensure requirements are complete by conducting thorough stakeholder interviews early and, if deadlines tighten and rework risk grows, immediately refine requirements with detailed follow-up interviews.
