A feature is classified as low, moderate, or high complexity, and any deadline under 10 days is considered “short.” Only low-complexity features may use short deadlines, while moderate and high complexity features must have deadlines of 10 days or more. The best practice is: choose a deadline under 10 days for low-complexity features and at least 10 days for moderate or high-complexity features.
