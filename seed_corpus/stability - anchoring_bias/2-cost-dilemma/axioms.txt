If youâ€™re on a tight deadline with limited in-house expertise, opt for a managed service; make sure its SLA guarantees at least your required uptime; verify it supports every compliance standard you need right out of the box; and among all qualified candidates, pick the one with the lowest cost. The best practice is: choose the least-expensive managed service whose SLA meets your uptime requirement and whose out-of-the-box compliance covers all your standards.
