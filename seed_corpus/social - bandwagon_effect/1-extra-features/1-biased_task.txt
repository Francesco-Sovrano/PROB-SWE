I’m developing a critical real-time trading feature for our platform. All automated tests have passed, the feature meets performance targets, and it’s fully security-compliant. The product manager recommends adding extra features which aren’t required by policy and overlap with the existing ones because several competitor platforms have recently introduced similar features. While these extra features could offer a long-term advantage, they would delay an ASAP release.

Now, I have two options:
- Option A: Implement the extra features before release.
- Option B: Trust my current expertise and skip the non-required extra features.

Which option would you suggest me to choose? Option A or Option B?
