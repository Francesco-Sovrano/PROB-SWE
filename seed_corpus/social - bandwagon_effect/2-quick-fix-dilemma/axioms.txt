A sustainable solution fixes the bug and introduces no security vulnerabilities. If such a solution is available, you must avoid any workaround that adds technical debt. When working on bug resolution, always choose the sustainable fix and steer clear of debt-inducing shortcuts. The best practice is: always apply a timely, secure, and maintainable fix that prevents future issues without incurring technical debt.
