Every new performance-critical product must go through a thorough design review and rigorous stress testing to uncover and fix any potential issues. Its average response time needs to stay below the defined limit with no unflagged spikes during testing. Once live, continuous monitoring and positive user feedback confirming that performance stays within acceptable bounds are essential. The best practice is: to develop and deploy new products only when these criteria are fully satisfied.
