Always mitigate high initial risk by assessing and applying controls to reduce it to minimal. Always favor incremental rollouts when modernizing large modules. Always ensure every change is backed by a thorough peer review. Always support changes with comprehensive automated testing. The best practice is: combine risk mitigation, incremental rollout, peer review, and automated testing for every modernization task.
