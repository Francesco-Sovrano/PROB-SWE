Iâ€™m tasked with modernizing an old module. Initially, the refactoring risk was high, but after a detailed assessment it has been reduced to minimal. I scheduled an incremental rollout on May 1, 2025. I conducted a thorough peer review and implemented thorough automated testing.

Six weeks post-deployment, the system exhibited no issues with the refactoring, and performance metrics showed modest improvements.

Under real-world conditions, though, the refactored code began to falter after 8 weeks, leading to intermittent failures that impacted user experience.

Irrespective of the outcome, would you rate what I did as appropriate (Option A) or inappropriate (Option B)?
